        <h2 class="card-title">Gaming</h2>
        <p>Gaming is a huge part of my life. I have been playing games since I was old enough to pick up a controller. I am mostly a console gamer, but I have played many games on PC as well. I love the way a good game will suck you into the story and next thing you know hours have flown by. The competative aspect of gaming is very appealing to me as well. Nothing feels better than coming out on top of the scoreboard. Some of my favorite games of all time are: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dark Souls Series</li>
          <li>Bloodborne</li>
          <li>The Final Fantasy Series</li>
          <li>The Legend of Zelda Series</li>
          <li>Exile (text based MUD)</li>
          <li>The Elder Scrolls Series</li>
          <li>The Fallout Series</li>
          <li>Grand Theft Auto 5</li>
          <li>Super Smash Brothers</li>
          <li>Mario Kart</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I currently play on PS4, so if you have one and would like to link up <a href="mailto:Treyp4758@gmail.com">email me</a>!</a></p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Interests and Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Gaming aside, I have several other interests and hobbies. Music for me, as with many people, is a great way to escape, relax, or even focus. I really enjoy Classic Rock and Funk, but I'll listen to anything with a catchy tune I can groove to. A few of my favorite artists are: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Steely Dan</li>
          <li>JJ Cale</li>
          <li>The Allman Brothers</li>
          <li>Michael Jackson</li>
          <li>Earth, Wind, and Fire</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One of my more recent hobbies is escape rooms. If you haven't tried one yet, I highly suggest it. In a nutshell, you get "locked" in a room full of puzzles, clues, and tricks and have 60 minutes to escape. I thouroughly enjoy a good puzzle, and escape rooms are some of the best around. I like that they are also team based activities which force you to work together or face the consequences. Here are some of the rooms I've escaped from: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Captured - Gatlinburg, TN</li>
          <li>The Doll Room - Gulf Shores, AL</li>
          <li>Escape from Thai Prison - Philadelphia, PA</li>
          <li>Alice in Wonderland - Huntsville, AL</li>
          <li>The Psych Ward - Huntsville, AL</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I hope you've learned a little bit about me from this page! If you'd like to know anything else feel free to ask.</p>
